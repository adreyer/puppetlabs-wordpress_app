## Description

The Puppet wordpress_app is a module that demonstrates example application module. The module contains application components you can use to  to set up a Wordpress database, a PHP application server, and an HAProxy load balancer. With these components, you can build two Wordpress applications: a simple LAMP stack or a stack that uses complex load-balancing.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

To use this module, you must enable application management on the Puppet master. If you've already installed PE, you can [enable this setting via the console](./orchestrator_install.html#enable-the-application-orchestration-service-and-orchestrator-client) or by adding  `app_management = true` to the `puppet.conf` file on your Puppet master. You also need to enable plug in sync on any agents you want to use to host application components.

The [Puppet orchestrator documentation](./orchestrator_intro.html) provides commands and API endpoints you can use to deploy the wordpress_app. 

### Getting started with wordpress_app

The simplest use of the wordpress_app module is to install Wordpress on a single node. For example, you can add the application declaration to your `site.pp`:

```puppet
  wordpress_app::simple { 'all_in_one':
    nodes => {
      Node['kermit-1.example.com'] => [
        Wordpress_app::Database['all_in_one'],
        Wordpress_app::Web['all_in_one'],
      ]
    }
  }
```

After deploying this application, you can access it at `http://kermit-1.example.com`.

## Patterns

### `wordpress_app::simple`

This is a simple wordpress application model. The three components are defined staticly in the application definition with their name expected to match the applications. The ddatbase component produces a database resource, the web component consumes that resource and produces and Http resource which in turn is consumed by the Lb. component.

This style of declaration works well if every instance of the application has the same components. It makes it easier to assign components to a single node or spread them across multiple nodes in different instances.

### `wordpress_app`

This is a more complex application definition. It uses functions to dynamically
discover what components have been declared, validate them and wire them
together. This type of definition works well when there may be a varying number
of components or some components are optional. By discovering the compontent
names dynamically the user doesn't have to worry about matching staticly
declared component names.

```puppet
  $db_components = collect_component_titles($nodes, Wordpress_app::Database)
  if (size($db_components) != 1){
    $db_size = size($db_components)
    fail("There must be one database component for wordpress_app. found: ${db_size}")
  }
  wordpress_app::database { $db_components[0]:
    database   => $database,
    user       => $db_user,
    password   => $db_pass,
    export     => Database["wdp-${name}"]
  }
```

The `collect_component_titles` function searches through the applications nodes
and finds all resources matching a certain component type and returns a list of
their titles. In this case we verify that there is one and only one database
and then declare that resource. The name of the exported Database capability
resource is set for internal consumption the user shouldn't have to know it.

```puppet
  $web_components = collect_component_titles($nodes, Wordpress_app::Web)
  # Verify there is at least one web.
  if (size($web_components) == 0) {
    fail("Found no web component for Wordpress_app[${name}]. At least one is required")
  }
  # For each of these declare the component and create an array of the exported
  # Http resources from them for the load balancer.
  $web_https = $web_components.map |$comp_name| {
    # Compute the Http resource title for export and return.
    $http = Http["web-$comp_name"]
    # Declare the web component.
    wordpress_app::web { $comp_name:
      apache_port => $web_port,
      interface   => $web_int,
      consume     => Database["wdp-${name}"],
      export      => $http,
    }
    # Return the $http resource for the array.
    $http
  }
```

For the web components we collect all resources assigned to nodes in the
application. We then use the map function to loop over them declaring the
components and collecting the Http resources they export for later consumption.
This allows the user to declare one or more web components to scale their
application dynamically through the declaration.

```puppet
  $lb_components = collect_component_titles($nodes, Wordpress_app::Lb)
  $lb_components.each |$comp_name| {
    wordpress_app::lb { $comp_name:
      balancermembers => $web_https,
      lb_options      => $lb_options,
      ipaddress       => $lb_listen_ip,
      port            => $lb_listen_port,
      balance_mode    => $lb_balance_mode,
      require         => $web_https,
      export          => Http["lb-${name}"],
    }
  }
```

The load balancer component for the application is optional and their may be
any number of instances of it. This allows users to not use a load balancer in
instances of the application where one isn't necessary or use multiple load
balancers if required for availability. Each load balancer requires the
web-http resources exported by the webs to ensure ordering and also passes
those resources in via the `balancermembers` parameter. This allows the load
balancer to collect an number of Http resources.


The following declares an instance of the wordpress application with two web
nodes and a single load balancer. Note that the resource titles used here are
arbitrary but much be unique in this environment.

```puppet
  wordpress_app { 'tiered':
    nodes => {
      # The titles of these don't matter as long as they're unique per component
      Node['kermit-1.example.com'] => Wordpress_app::Database['wordpress-db'],
      Node['kermit-2.example.com'] => Wordpress_app::Lb['tiered'],
      Node['kermit-3.example.com'] => Wordpress_app::Web['tiered-web01'],
      Node['kermit-4.example.com'] => Wordpress_app::Web['wordpress-web02'],
    }
  }
```

### Components vs Profiles

If you are already organizing your code into roles and profiles the application
components are probably very similiar to your profiles. If all your nodes serve
a single purpose you may be able to just convert your profile classes into
component defined types. If you need to put multiple components on a single
node that share resources this may resut in conflicts.  For example if you have
one database node that provide datbases for multiple wordpress application
instances mysql puppet resources may be shared or if you had multiple http
components in your stack apache resources might be shared. In this case the
shared resources should be factored out of the components into profile classes
which can then be included in the component. An example of this is
`wordpress_app:database` and `workpress_app::database_profile`. The underlying
mysql server and firewall rules are configured in the profile while the
specific datbase, user, and permissions are managed in the component.
